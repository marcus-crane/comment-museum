# Comment Museum

This was a fun experiment at capturing comments from stuff.co.nz in order to see which ones were ranked worst to best.

I'm open sourcing it for laughs, like a lot of my older work but it's probably unusable nowadays given the stuff.co.nz redesign.

I believe they also turned off commenting quite some years back as well.
